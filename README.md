# HackExpo2018

This is my solution to HackExpo2018 competition.

**Problem statement**

In modern cities, road traffic congestion and accidents have both led to loss of valuable times and lives and has become a severe problem for cities. Automated Traffic Control systems can alleviate the hazards of road congestion and accidents by providing real-time statistics about the state of the road. This systems can potentially save lives by autonomously reporting Accidents and Fire Incidents on the road the moment they occur. Thanks to recent advances in Deep Learning, such traffic control and road safety systems are now possible.
